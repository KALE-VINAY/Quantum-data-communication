# Quantum-data-communication
Quantum data communication using qubits to send the classical data and E91 protocol-based quantum secure communication (QKD). Here, we have developed hybrid architecture using E91 Direct Variable Quantum Key Distribution protocol-based Quantum communication for transmission of data with HDLC fames in the existing internet. The hybrid architecture was implemented and simulated in IBM Quantum lab using Qiskit supported by Python. The simulation results ensure successful transmission of HDLC data frames using Qubits and successful recovery data after quantum measurements. Our findings shows the resistance to security issues such as identity disclosure, traceability, message authentication and eavesdropping attacks. The implementation of hybrid approach opens an avenue for quantum internet working with HDLC framing.
